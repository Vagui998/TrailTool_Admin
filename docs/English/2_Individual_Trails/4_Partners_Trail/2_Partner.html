 explaining why transdisciplinarity is important, it is necessary to 
understand its essential meaning. Despite the existence of multiple 
understandings, this TRAIL defines transdisciplinarity as “the 
integration of academic researchers from different disciplines with 
non-academic participants in the co-creation of new knowledge and theory
 to achieve a common goal” (OECD, 2021). This definition paves the way 
for distinguishing three characteristic features.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">The
 first relates to the type of collaboration partners involved. In 
transdisciplinarity, partners from academic institutes and especially 
non-academic backgrounds are involved in the design or research process.
 Furthermore, this team should exist of researchers/experts of different
 disciplinary backgrounds. Indeed, the seemingly similar concept of 
interdisciplinarity is an intrinsic part here, however with the addition
 of broader societal voices as well. The scope of participant 
backgrounds ranging behind academia – thus, your participation – is what
 sets transdisciplinarity collaborations apart.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">This
 diverse group of transdisciplinary participants is bounded by the issue
 in which they are involved, the second characteristic feature. 
Transdisciplinarity is by its very nature about involvement in complex 
societal issues where there is no clear solution and working method to 
arrive at that solution. These type problems are commonly referred to as
 wicked problems (Williams, 2022). Because straightforward definitions 
and solutions are impossible for these types of problems, 
transdisciplinarity arrives as a new working method.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">Transdisciplinarity
 can be understood as a metatheory, a new kind of knowledge. It adopts 
different methodologies from different disciplines to transform and 
transcend them. It ensures the emergence of new concepts and approaches 
related to the wicked problem at hand. As these problems are always 
grounded in the real world - thanks to the collaboration with you, 
non-academic partners, transdisciplinarity serves society in a direct 
way (Mokiy, 2019).</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">The
 third feature of transdiscplinarity distinguished here, relates to the 
form of involvement. With transdisciplinarity, all partners work 
together based on equality. There is no single way to define the mutual 
relations, as everyone should be learning together to generate new 
knowledge and innovative idea (Visscher, 2023). As one author once said:
 here are no transdisciplinary experts, only transdisciplinary 
practitioners (Mokiy, 2019).</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">The
 TRAIL provides extensive guidelines and insights on the practical 
effects and challenges of these three features. The TRAIL focuses on 
transdisciplinary education, which means that students are part of the 
transdisciplinary project. The tool is created with the focus on 
education. However, ideally, all participants add the same value. In the
 end, transdisciplinarity is very much about learning and transformation
 for everyone involved.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">Links:</p><ul style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;"><li>Collaborative partners</li><li>Nature of the problem</li><li>Form of engagement</li><li>Common goal</li></ul></body></html>
