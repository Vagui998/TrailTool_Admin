 society changes fast, and not always towards the better. So-called 
‘wicked problems’ are accountable for important parts of this change. 
These new emerging challenges call for a broader approach, bridging many
 disciplines and societal actors to collectively co-create sustainable 
futures. To safeguard our own and societies future, we should question 
and adapt our working methods. Transdisciplinarity is a building block 
in these changes. Participating in transdisciplinary education 
specifically, provides the possibility to develop new perspectives on 
existing challenges, and prepares a new generation of professionals to 
approach the future in a way that meets the requirements of an 
ever-changing world.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;"><strong>Advancing future skill sets</strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">Prospective
 professionals need problem-solving skills, such as collaborating with -
 and understanding of - people with different points of view, the 
ability to perceive how different viewpoints are interconnected within a
 larger system, an open attitude and willingness to learn from others, 
valuing diverse forms of knowledge. Education needs to train people who 
can make changes and face recent problems effectively. It gives space to
 personal development and general competences to obtain these skills 
while working in real-life world problems. By bringing in the voice and 
perspectives from everyday life stakeholders, you can contribute to the 
educational formation this generation. A generation that you are 
probably awaiting as well.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;"><strong>Wicked problems</strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">Young
 people should not only be educated to become a skilled professional, 
but they are also the next generation who must carry the complex 
societal problems of tomorrow. To train them in early stages to deal 
with these so-called wicked problems (problems without a clear solution,
 in which multiple perspectives are needed to address the problem), they
 need to be challenged with real-life problems. In this way, they learn 
to understand that wicked problems are beyond disciplines and 
collaboration is essential. You, as a partner from this ‘real’ world, 
are essential to create learning communities together with researchers, 
teachers and students from different disciplines. As we address big 
challenges in these communities, all parties learn about the wicked 
problem, can include new perspectives, and contribute to serious change.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;"><strong>Life-long learning</strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">A
 transdisciplinary education includes learning for everyone involved, 
not just students. Thus, as a partner, you should approach this TRAIL 
with the mindset to learn yourself and be willing to address changing 
factors in your organization or as a citizen.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">Links:</p><ul style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;"><li>Future thinking</li><li>Holism</li><li>Inner development goals</li><li>Systemic change</li></ul></body></html>
