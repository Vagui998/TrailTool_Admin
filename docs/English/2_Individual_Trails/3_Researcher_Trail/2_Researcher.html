 despite its varied nuanced definitions (Klein, 2018), involves some 
consistent elements that make it stand out between other 
cross-disciplinary forms of collaboration. The first element focuses on 
the type of collaborating partners: academic and non-academic partners 
learn, work, and research together in transdisciplinary settings (Klein,
 2018; Visscher, 2023). The second element concerns the nature of the 
addressed problem, emphasizing complex societal issues lacking singular 
solutions, often referred to as wicked problems (Williams, 2022). The 
third element revolves around the nature of engagement: different 
partners learn and work on an equal basis, truly collaboratively 
generating new knowledge and theory (Visscher, 2023).</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">This
 TRAIL has a special focus on transdisciplinary education, those types 
of projects of which education is a part, and the educational processes 
in a transdisciplinary project. However, ‘education’ is definitely 
regarded as one singular most important stakeholder of the mix. The 
TRAIL is designed to meet all interests in an equal way. Often, the 
differences between these interests overlap more than one might think on
 a first glance, and education is an important change maker for all 
parties in this society. You find more about the educational perspective
 of transdisciplinarity on the next page.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Equality in Transdisciplinary Collaboration</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">In
 transdisciplinary collaboration, partners contribute on an equal basis,
 creating, learning, working, and researching together to generate new 
knowledge and theories (Visscher, 2023). Discussions with experts within
 and beyond Avans University of Applied Science – where this TRAIL tool 
is developed – underscore the absence of a shared understanding of 
transdisciplinarity. Particularly in relation to interdisciplinarity, 
distinctions appear unclear, with transdisciplinarity often 
characterized as dealing with complexities in societal issues and 
collaboration with stakeholders.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;"><span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 600;">Inter-, or transdisciplinary: a common confusion.</span><br></p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">Academic
 literature and dialogues with experts, underscore the absence of a 
shared understanding of transdisciplinarity. Particularly the 
distinction with interdisciplinary collaboration, is often unclear. 
Where both approaches strive towards the integration of different types 
of knowledge, transdisciplinarity distinguishes itself by the 
involvement of non-academic stakeholders as equal participants in the 
same project. In transdisciplinarity, the diversity of perspectives and 
‘types of knowledge’ are higher, and the problem at hand tends to be 
more complex. As the complexity increases, so do the challenges and 
learning opportunities in transdisciplinary collaborations increase as 
well. That is why there is TRAIL.</p><ul style="margin-bottom: 16px; padding-left: 20px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;"><li>Collaborative partners</li><li>Nature of the problem</li><li>Form of engagement</li><li>Common goal</li></ul>                                          </body></html>
