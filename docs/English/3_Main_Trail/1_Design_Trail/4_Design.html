 transdisciplinary education is not a regular course with tests and 
exams, the assessment can be a challenge. Furthermore, if the 
transdisciplinary team wants to strive for equality between the team 
members, assessment can be a disturbance in this equality, since most 
probable teachers need to assess students which causes a hierarchy. 
Luckily, there are multiple ways to assess within transdisciplinary 
education.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Focus on the Process</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">As
 mentioned before, the development of competences is most crucial. This 
enhances that it the assessment is happening on longer stretches of time
 (learning lines). Furthermore, since personal and professional 
transformation are an integral result of transdisciplinary working – 
changing the grand challenge at hand by transforming ones own and others
 perspective towards the problem – formulating personal learning goals 
or assessment criteria for all team members (not just students or 
teachers) is of essential value.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Reflection</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">It
 is important to spend ample time explaining the purpose of reflection 
to the team members. Reflection is a powerful tool if only used in the 
right way. As basic premise, it can be stated that effective reflection 
should follow on actual meaningful experiences – which the grand 
challenge centered transdisciplinary project should be about to create. 
The exercises are to help the team members set personal goals and 
expectations and help in achieving them. For example, a first reflection
 could happen before the program on what the team member is expecting, 
what they think their strengths and weaknesses are and what competences 
they want to work on. Throughout the TRAIL you can ask the team members 
to take that original reflection and examine whether they have made 
progress or if some things have changed.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Flexible Frameworks</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">A
 form to reflect is through the creation of a portfolio and development 
interviews (Gulikers, 2023). The book ‘Meaningful Assessment in 
Interdisciplinary Education’ could be a form of inspiration for 
transdisciplinary assessment although it is created for 
interdisciplinary education.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">Additionally,
 there is the question of who is being assessed and who is assessing. 
Since the program is in an educational setting, the student should have a
 sort of assessment. To maintain equality between all participants, 
other participants should also have some form of assessment. Otherwise, 
the aim of equality between all participants is shifting if only the 
student is assessed.</p></body></html>
