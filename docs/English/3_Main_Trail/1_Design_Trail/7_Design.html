 important consideration is the location of the transdisciplinary 
learning environment. Various options exist, including organizing it on 
the school campus, at an external venue, online, or adopting a hybrid 
approach that combines both on- and offline elements. Conducting the 
program on campus has the advantage of well-equipped rooms with 
materials for work, learning, and collaboration, including projectors, 
screens, tables, chairs, and Wi-Fi. Additionally, the on-campus setting 
is accessible and familiar to students, potentially reducing barriers to
 participation. However, for societal partners, campuses are outside 
their comfort zone.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">Choosing
 an external location can be inspiring, offering existing wicked 
problems for participants to tackle. This setting becomes a space for 
experimentation, research, and collaboration, often involving societal 
partners already engaged in the location where the learning environment 
occurs. Moreover, it breaks the routine of a familiar environment, 
creating a neutral space where each participant can engage on an equal 
footing.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">Considering
 the context is crucial. What kind of environment do you want to create 
with the participants? Is it meant to be informal, practical, or social?
 The choice depends on the wicked problem being addressed. For instance,
 at Avans Hogeschool, Helios (Hybrid External Learning and Innovation 
environments) extend beyond the classroom. De Kleine Aarde, a food 
garden, focuses on issues related to food transition, biodiversity, and 
soil. Meanwhile, WijWest, a neighbor center, addresses social issues 
like neighborhood loneliness or youth criminality.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">Therefore,
 selecting the environment and context should align with the wicked 
problem being addressed, the involved parties, and the program format.</p><img src="7_Design_files/hybride-leeromgevingen_configuraties-op-continuum-school-wer.PNG" alt="Hybrid Learning Environments" style="max-width: 100%; height: 255.438px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; width: 786.286px;"></body></html>
