 transdisciplinary learning environment is learner-driven and allows 
participants to experience and experiment with a transdisciplinary 
process. Where the participants will end up at the end cannot be 
completely defined because they have the space and freedom to try 
different things. Some ideas will work and others will not, but through 
experimentation creativity is engaged.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Iterative Process</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">Learning
 iteratively is how we learn naturally. In a transdisciplinary approach,
 when handling wicked problems, learning iteratively is the only way 
forward. Because transdisciplinary research deals with complex and 
unsolvable (wicked) problems, every attempt to answer such an issue is 
prone to bringing about new or unforeseen consequences. Its complexity 
relates to many diverging factors. It concerns different and often 
conflicting desires from stakeholders and appears to evolve organically 
together with whatever approach is decided upon, generating new issues 
that need to be tackled. Therefore, the problem needs to be regularly 
revisited, re-analysed, re-framed and the plan of action rethought in 
iterative processes.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">The
 iterative process can be confusing and frustrating because a big part 
of the learning process is about the unknown. This is for all 
participants, both students, teachers, researchers, and societal 
partners.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Learning by Doing</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">To
 learn more about the challenge and develop the transversal skills 
needed to tackle real-life issues, the program should guide participants
 through one or two iterations. The approach to addressing wicked 
problems fits closely to the human learning process as described by 
Kolb’s theory of experiential learning (Learning by Doing). We learn a 
lot by continuously establishing thoughts, putting those ideas into 
action and then reflecting upon them. That reflection leads to deeper 
insights and new ideas, which can then be put into action again and 
reflected upon, starting another cycle or iteration anew. Reflecting on 
what we do ourselves follows the iterative approach to the wicked 
problem of life. Missing in Kolb’s theory is, however, the need for 
other actors to co-create a new type of knowledge.</p></body></html>
