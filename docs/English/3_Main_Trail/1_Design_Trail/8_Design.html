 designing a framework for the program, such as the format, the theme 
and the location. It is important to find a way to implement the program
 in the institute. It is important to have the support of the 
organization. Since transdisciplinary education requires experimentation
 space it is important to have sufficient time from all partners and 
money to make sure that the quality of learning stays high. A common 
problem on this point is that transdisciplinary education is often a 
pilot project that is not embedded in the organization yet. Therefore, 
mostly teachers invest a lot of their time to make this program happen 
with subsidy for innovative learning programs. However, to continue the 
program is frequently a challenge.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">It
 is important to involve the institute into the development of the 
program and provide time and resources to make it able to happen. This 
requires flexibility of the organization since transdisciplinary 
education is not designed to follow in the race of efficiency and 
scaling up.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">There
 are a few possibilities to divide time and resources, found in multiple
 interesting practices. Resources could come from multiple sources. For 
example, the transdisciplinary program could be connected with a 
research group who has the finances to spend time to join a 
transdisciplinary program and can use the results for their own 
research. Also, societal partners could provide a location for the 
students and invest time to interact with them.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Questions to Consider:</h2><h3 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Time</h3><ul style="margin-bottom: 16px; padding-left: 20px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;"><li>How much time is needed from every participant to join a transdisciplinary team?</li><li>Is there time for experimentation?</li><li>Is this equally divided?</li><li>How can it be ensured that time is well managed?</li></ul><h3 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Money</h3><ul style="margin-bottom: 16px; padding-left: 20px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;"><li>Who
 is providing money? A few possibilities are the university as a part of
 educational programs, external funding or co-funding of collaborating 
partners.</li><li>Another question is who gets paid? Does all 
collaborators such as partners, researchers and teachers get paid for 
this work or are they joining â€˜in-kind with the common goal as an 
outcome and a return?</li></ul></body></html>
