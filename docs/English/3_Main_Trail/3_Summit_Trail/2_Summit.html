                  <p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">Although
 there is no guarantee for a predetermined result, a transdisciplinary 
collaboration can lead to a wide variety of project outcomes because it 
is learner-driven. It might lead to innovative solutions to local 
challenges such as water usage, or a pitch or a proposition to local 
officials, or a conference for local stakeholders, or a game, or a 
movie, or a comic, or a podcast, or a website, … These are all tangible 
outcomes of the project that could be assessed on their direct impact.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">Based
 on the learning goals and the tool of ‘innovatie werkplaatsen’ (Cremers
 et. Al, 2017), there are multiple possible tangible outcomes such as 
knowledge acquisition or action-oriented outcomes.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Knowledge/products</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">One
 of the possible outcomes is knowledge acquisition in the form of 
concepts, instruments, or models to support others to tackle the wicked 
problem that is worked upon. Furthermore, design products in the form of
 a prototype can be created.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Action-oriented outcomes</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">Another
 form of outcome could be action-oriented. This means that there can be 
an intervention in a certain place. This could be in the form of a 
workshop, a meeting, a training, a gathering, or a change in the 
environment. Therefore, participants need to roll up their sleeves and 
act upon a transformation in the environment they are working in. An 
example of such an action-oriented outcome is a workshop in the Act for 
Change minor at Avans University of Applied Science. As part of this 
program workshop, students of worked together with refugees to mobilize 
them to connect to each other through sport activities. It can be a 
small gesture, that grows into something bigger. This way, fertile 
ground for societal growth is created by a transdisciplinary project.</p></body></html>
