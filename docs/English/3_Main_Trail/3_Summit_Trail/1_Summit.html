 direction in which the team is exploring solutions is not set in 
advance. The point of transdisciplinary learning is to be innovative. 
This comes with the risk that the team may not be advancing too much in 
the direction of a solution. If they choose to stay longer with the 
problem, this may also be very valuable. Since there is the possibility 
of understanding the problem better from different perspectives. Often, 
solutions to certain problems are not suitable since the problem is 
being misunderstood. Therefore, understanding the problem or recognizing
 the complexity of the problem can be a crucial outcome.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Understanding the not-knowing</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">A
 possible outcome is the understanding that there is no joint solution 
for the specific problem. This can be disappointing. However, it can 
also create the possibility to step back to redefine the problem and to 
look at the system in which the problem is created. This could lead to 
further questions or different problems that need to be addressed first 
to tackle the chosen wicked problem.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Understanding multiple perspectives</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">Another
 possible outcome could be the understanding of different perspectives 
on the same problem. This can be achieved by working with people from 
another discipline, another sector, and/or another cultural background. 
In this sense, boundaries are crossed. This also opens a possibility to 
reflect on your own perspective. Questions arise such as: how do I look 
at the problem? It helps with defining your own positionality and 
understanding the complexity of multiple perspectives.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Set expectations</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">You
 are now aware that the outcome of a transdisciplinary collaboration is 
not just the innovative idea or “product” that the team comes up with. 
To avoid disappointment from the side of the students, other teachers, 
or stakeholders you need to carefully manage the expectations from the 
start.</p></body></html>
