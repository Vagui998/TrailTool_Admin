 we stand at the start of the participation phase, we quickly go back to
 basics one more time. The practice of transdisciplinary education can 
be ambiguous, filled with practical doubts and struggles. Especially 
when these problems occur, it is important to remember the core-values. 
Recall what stayed with you from entering the TRAIL. Transdisciplinary 
projects are designed to make progress on real-world problems, empower 
futureproof education, and hear the voices of all actors involved. This 
requires genuine interests in other participants and equality among team
 members.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Recruitment</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">Before
 starting off, the first step is the recruitment of project 
participants, as far as the complete team has not been formed in the 
basecamp or design phase. There is the possibility to recruit based on 
background (disciplines), motivation, or grades (in case of the 
students). Motivation is an important criterion because every motivated 
participant should have the opportunity to participate in 
transdisciplinary education.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Safe environment</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">Next,
 when actually coming together, you really feel that the journey 
progresses – an exciting reality. Following the transdisciplinary core 
values, we need to ensure mutual trust and freedom for everyone. 
Establishing a safe environment is a must for successful 
transdisciplinary collaboration. In a next page below, lessons from the 
TRAIL-research and the Praktijkgids Transdiscipinair werken (Het Groene 
Brein, 2023), help you getting started with this.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Co-creation</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">After
 kicking off, you will soon discover the challenges in the practical 
organization of collaboration. The presence of many different team 
members also means: many different agendas, meetings, and preferences to
 take into account. In order to keep track and don’t lose the 
collaborative flow, a specific page provides you with practical 
organization advice from experienced experts. For example, have a look 
at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.versnellingsplan.nl/Kennisbank/learning-community-tool/">Learning Community Tool</a>,
 which provides an insightful and hands-on tool for the development of 
co-creation. This tool among others suggests sticking to weekly team 
meetings, creating a blended community according to five design 
principles, and using concrete already existing collaboration tools, for
 which this TRAIL provides inspiration as well.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">Nobody said it would be easy, but exactly therefore we embark on the most exciting phase of this adventure: lets participate!</p></body></html>
