 mindsets, roles, and tasks does a transdisciplinary team have? And how 
about you: how exactly can you participate and contribute to the 
project? We distinguish different tasks and related roles in a 
transdisciplinary project. These include: acting, decision making, and 
guiding. Different roles can, of course, and probably will overlap.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Acting</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">This
 basic task of ‘acting’ in a process concerns your own contributions, no
 matter your role in the process or position as a stakeholder. Don’t 
hesitate to take responsibility, get off your own beaten track but also 
make sure you ask others to do the same. Remember that you are in it 
together. Another shared attitude intrinsic to transdisciplinarity is a 
research mindset. As nothing is clear at the beginning of a 
transdisciplinary project, you should be ready to create and explore new
 knowledge.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Decision making</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">Decisions
 in the project are made by different actors, not just those with the 
most experience or the loudest voice. In the safe environment of the 
transdisciplinary project, everyone should be listened to.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Guiding</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">At
 the same time, sometimes one individual has to oversee the entire 
process, spark break thoughts, and balance the needs of the group with 
the practical framework. We call these people ‘guides’. Guides have 2 
distinct roles in transdisciplinary projects. They first of all set up 
and co-design the TRAIL, and later on foster the processes as coaches. 
This applies especially, but not solely, to the educational environment 
in which teachers or other students can guide the learning process of 
participating students.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">No
 matter the role you adopt during the project, you also enter the 
process from a certain stakeholders position. The previous experience 
from this position will almost certainly influence the way you 
experience a transdisciplinary process. Therefore, the following 
sub-pages discuss the roles and tasks for each stakeholder, including 
particular typical changes in habits compared to disciplinary 
professional or educational realities.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">Links:</p><ul style="margin-bottom: 16px; padding-left: 20px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;"><li><a href="https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ehh&amp;AN=124060621&amp;site=ehost-live">Paper on changing role of educator</a></li><li><a href="https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=eric&amp;AN=EJ1071574&amp;site=ehost-live">Creativity in the classroom</a></li></ul></body></html>
