 everything you have learned so far, you can hopefully imagine that the 
slogan ‘communication is key’ applies strongly to transdisciplinary 
collaboration. However, this is easier said than done. What do you have 
to take into account concerning communication? And what tools can you 
use to smoothen it? This page provides lessons and examples.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Common language</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">For
 smooth communication, it is essential to have a mutual understanding of
 what your team is about to do. In other words, you need a Common 
Vision, which in turn also requires a Common Language. To establish 
this, you have to gain insight into your own and each other’s 
backgrounds. Where the use of some terms might be obvious to you and 
your peers, people from other disciplines may understand the same words 
totally differently.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Communication Tools</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">This
 part of the TRAIL discusses strategies to develop a common language and
 vision. The Theory of Change exercise, for example, is found suitable 
to capture the diversity in a transdisciplinary team. This exercise is 
used in co-creation processes to create a clear mission plan, to align 
members around a common vision, to unearth hidden misconceptions, and to
 analyze how the long-term goals can be reached.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">Breaking
 the walls between silos of all participants disciplines and professions
 doesn’t happen at once. Really understanding each other requires 
continuous reflection. That sounds somewhat heavy, but it basically 
comes down to the fact that you should never forget to pose questions by
 everything you and others say. Do I understand it rightly? And: are 
others likely to rightly understand what I want to communicate? Feeling 
free and safe to speak out in the team is, once again, essential in this
 aspect. Only this way disciplinary boundaries can be surpassed, and 
through transdisciplinary knowledge arises.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Verbindend communiceren</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">For
 the adventurous readers who want to go more in-depth on this topic: 
Behind the development of a common language is the mutual understanding 
of each others beliefs (epistemological and methodological). You can try
 to go in depth, even if not all team members are yet familiar with the 
project.</p></body></html>
