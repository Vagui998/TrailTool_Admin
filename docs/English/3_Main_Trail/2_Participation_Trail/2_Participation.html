 the design phase, you might have already encountered theoretical 
insights into the transdisciplinary learning process. Let’s now turn 
these ideas into practices. This part of the TRAIL offers hands-on 
advice, tools, and reflections on the execution of the learning 
experience.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Iterative process</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">As
 quoted earlier, it is the journey that matters most in 
transdisciplinarity. This also applies to the way we learn in a project.
 Transdisciplinary learning is iterative learning. When handling wicked 
problems, iterative learning is the only way forward. Because of its 
multifaceted changing nature, you need to regularly revisit the problem 
and rethink the plan of action over the course of the project.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Transformation</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">This
 comes with the risk that the team may not be advancing too much towards
 a direct solution. You can set some basic output requirements to guide 
the process towards a solution, but the transformation during the 
iterative learning process is maybe even more important output – though 
less clear. Iterative learning is a way of working on the wicked problem
 at hand, as it transforms all the involved stakeholders and this way 
the wicked problem itself.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Unpredictable outcomes</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">The
 open-ended nature of transdisciplinary projects can be confusing and 
frustrating to students and other stakeholders alike. Regular courses or
 work projects offer clear tangible output or requirements, while a 
transdisciplinary project may seem never-ending. Sub-pages below focus 
on the way this open-endedness can affect different stakeholders – and 
how to cope with this.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">You
 don’t have to reinvent the wheel yourself during the process. Multiple 
tools and techniques have proven to be useful in transdisciplinary 
education. These tools relate to the learning strategies exemplified in 
the Design phase. After finding more information about them below, it is
 up to you to start using them! (and don’t forget to evaluate).</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">An example of a guiding tool is the Inner Development Goals (IDG’s): as discussed in the video above.</p></body></html>
