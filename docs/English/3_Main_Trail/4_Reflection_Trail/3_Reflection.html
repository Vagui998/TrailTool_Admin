Only by formulating future improvements and goals can the transdisciplinary iterative learning cycle continue. This applies to both the individual participants and the project in general.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">The transdisciplinary project may have been designed as a frequent recurring project, for example linked to an education program. In that case, reflection and the formulation of improvements are especially important as they can be implemented directly in the next project edition. Also, when no sequel is scheduled yet, the evaluation may provide individual stakeholders with inspiration and tools to found new transdisciplinary projects in the future – whether or not building upon the results from the initial one.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">External Communication</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">To ensure that the project outcomes and collaborative lessons are safeguarded, external communication is key. In sync with the diversity of stakeholders in the project team, an end product should preferably aim at a wide variety of audiences. Also, when a concrete end product lacks, there will always be a message to share with the world: recommendations for further research, inspiring insights from the process, or a ready-to-use toolkit for specific policymakers. Different types of communication strategies will be shared in a sub-page below, ranging from a single article to long-standing social media interaction.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">As part of this communication, you might try to ‘upscale’ the project: pass it on to other not yet involved parties that have an interest in the problem at hand. Therefore, make sufficient time to meet with policymakers and other societal partners, to convince them about the project outcomes and the – if possible – need for a follow-up.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;"><strong>Final Note:</strong>&nbsp;You are almost back down from the mountain. You can see other mountain tops waiting to be climbed as well. Be proud of what you achieved during this journey and may this be motivating to climb other mountains as well – maybe smoother now, but never without challenges. That makes transdisciplinary projects so close to the real world, valuable, and ever inspiring.</p></body></html>
