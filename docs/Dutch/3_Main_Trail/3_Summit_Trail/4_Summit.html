Because of the rich collaboration between different parties, the impact of the outcome has a greater chance of being effective. However, change does not happen in one day. Multiple outcomes, visible and invisible, have to evolve in order to create transformation. Since projects tend to be relatively short (from a week to ten weeks, maybe a year), it is important to think about a sustainable way to use, save and work further on gathered knowledge, products or skills.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Sustainable relationships</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">One of the important factors is sustaining durable relationships. For example, if there is a project in a neighborhood with students, researchers and residents, it can be harmful to come and go in the neighborhood for a short period of time only. Therefore, a solution could be to have a teacher, researcher or facilitator working for a durational time with the neighborhood. This way, a better understanding of the neighborhood can be developed and a more trustworthy relationship with the neighbors can be built. The need for longer relationships can also exist between participants, such as between students and societal partners. The latter could decide to work with the former in the longer run.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Estafette learning</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">To avoid superficial outcomes based on a short-time study or collaboration, there is the possibility to choose for estafette learning. This means that a transdisciplinary team is working further on the outcome another team has provided. This provides the possibility to understand, define or tackle the wicked problem in a grounded way. This is also a form of collaboration between different teams, although not at the same time. When choosing this model, it is important to carefully transfer the information, knowledge or actions that were created before.</p>
