Here, the learning effects come into play. A desired outcome is that all participants learn throughout the collaboration. Learning can take place on a cognitive level, in skills, or in developing values. For some participants such as the students, learning is a major goal. However, other participants should also benefit from the transdisciplinary collaboration to learn.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Development</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">As we have quoted earlier it is the journey, not the destination that matters most in this educational context. The intangible, the development of transversal competences and the inner development that every participant has experienced, far outweighs the final result the team members have come to. All participants work on their personal and professional development. Through working on a wicked problem from different perspectives, both interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral, people learn about their own expertise by the reflections of others and about the others experience and expertise. As explained in What to learn, multiple inner development takes place in being, thinking, relating, collaborating, and acting (<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_editor#">Inner development goals</a>).</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Intrinsic value</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">Another transformation can occur within the values of the participants. Through bringing in other perspectives, values can transform. For example, if students of business innovation work together with partners on Plaats De Kleine Aarde, an ecological center allied with Avans, University of Applied Science. The students shared that their vision on consumerism of meat has shifted because they were aware of the holistic consequences of meat production. The personal value transformation was in this case a possible great outcome.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Education for the future</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">The invisible outcomes of a transdisciplinary project can go beyond the individual level. In democratic countries such as the Netherlands, civilians should have a great sense of value in order to participate in democracy. Transdisciplinary education, which crosses boundaries and combines multiple perspectives, can play an active role in this field of politics. (Chad Hoggan &amp; Tanja Hoggan-Kloubert).</p>
