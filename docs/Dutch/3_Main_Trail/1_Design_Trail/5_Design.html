<img id="imagen" src=https://trailtool.org/images/designtrail05.jpg width="90%" onerror="this.style.display='none'"/><h1 style="font-size: 32px; line-height: 1.4; font-weight: 700; margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">How Does It Happen</h1><h2 style="margin-bottom: 12px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-weight: 600; line-height: 1.5; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 24px;">Format</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">To establish a transdisciplinary education structure, the initial step involves navigating through various available formats, taking into account factors such as student schedules, educational requirements, institutional possibilities, and innovative approaches across different faculties. The decision-making process should be driven by the desired outcomes for students and other learners, alongside the available support.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Intra- or Extracurricular</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">The first decision is whether the educational program is extra- or intracurricular. For instance, extracurricular options include summer- or winter school, involving short intensive courses outside the academic year, or an honors program that runs throughout the year alongside regular classes to broaden the learning program. Intra-curricular possibilities encompass regular classes, modules, minors, or a graduation project. Living labs and hackathons can be both extra- and intracurricular.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Time Commitment</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">It is essential for the chosen format to align with the preferences of participants around the table, such as students, researchers, teachers, and societal partners. Consideration should be given to whether all participants will be present simultaneously, potentially fostering a learning community with equality, or if there will be variations in the time commitment of different participants, such as researchers or societal partners. Shorter periods of time with all participants may facilitate a more equitable learning community, while longer stretches allow for a more in-depth exploration of multiple competencies.</p><h2 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Compulsory or Elective</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">The next consideration is whether the program will be compulsory or elective. Opting for an elective approach has the advantage of higher student and participant motivation. This inclusivity ensures the active involvement of researchers, students, teachers, and societal partners. Implementing admission requirements such as a motivation letter can further contribute to attracting the desired student profile. However, transdisciplinary education can be beneficial for all students, therefore, it could be a part of a compulsory class or program to encourage all students to learn to collaborate and meet different perspectives.</p>
