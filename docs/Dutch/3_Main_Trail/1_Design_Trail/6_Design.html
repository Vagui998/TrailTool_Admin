There can be multiple challenges or themes for selection or a singular challenge for one or more student teams. Organizers can either choose a challenge themselves or empower the participating group to select a challenge or collectively develop a challenge based on a general theme. Both have benefits and drawbacks.</p><h3 style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 10px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Organizers Can Define Challenge Themselves:</h3><ul style="margin-bottom: 16px; padding-left: 20px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;"><li>Students can participate in already existing collaborations or contribute to issues that partners experience within their field.</li><li>These challenges may emerge from within the institute, involving complex problems faced by teachers, researchers, or student-led initiatives. External actors, such as businesses, private or government-owned organizations, and local governments, can also contribute challenges, fostering direct collaboration. The origin of the wicked problem can influence the nature of collaboration, shifting between a consultative approach and an equal partnership.</li><li>Projects may create more impact as they are more interconnected and build on each other and previous projects.</li><li>Projects where relevant stakeholders are involved in the topic of choice, more often generate impact (Groothuijsen, 2021).</li></ul><h3 style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 10px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Empowering the Participating Group:</h3><ul style="margin-bottom: 16px; padding-left: 20px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;"><li>Student teams have the freedom to refine broader themes or wicked problems into a concrete challenge of their interest.</li><li>It fosters intrinsic motivation.</li><li>It may take more time as students need to find partners to work with.</li><li>It may take more time before teams delve into their chosen challenge, requiring initial deliberation on the specific aspect of the wicked problem to address collectively.</li><li>May create smaller impact as projects are less interconnected.</li><li>Local community issues are attractive and generate more impact.</li></ul><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">Local community issues, for instance, can enhance the attractiveness of a challenge. Addressing a challenge with local impact allows students to witness the tangible results of their efforts, fostering motivation and a sense of ownership. Research generates more impact if the project is not only relevant in general, but for the specific local practice (Groothuijsen, 2021). Tackling a local challenge also empowers participants to take initiative and implement their vision, promoting a sense of responsibility. Furthermore, choosing a local challenge facilitates student engagement, as it connects them with a readily available local network and encourages support from local authorities for the transdisciplinary collaboration.</p>
