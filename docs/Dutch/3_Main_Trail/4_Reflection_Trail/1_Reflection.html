Now it is time to return to the valley: assess what you have achieved, reflect on it and create the foundation for future steps. As you could read before in the Design phase, assessment of a transdisciplinary project can be a challenge with multiple dimensions.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">A first dimension concerns the possible different perspectives of the different stakeholders. Students and teachers for example, shall naturally – given the larger education system – be focused on assessment in terms of grading and study progress. Which might seem a totally different starting point then that of a policy maker or NGO, who will first and foremost assess in terms of usable solutions output.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">However, evaluation which does justice to the communal and possible transformative learning process in a transdisciplinary project, should be based on the co-existence of both outcome-oriented, intrinsic individual and team values learning goals (as discussed in the didactics phase).</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">A second dimension concerns the value of invisible project outcomes, the development of competences over the course of the project. As suggested earlier, these outcomes may be the most valuable of transdisciplinary working. This assessment requires other attitudes and tools then typical product assessment. After all, the development of personal competences is internal and cannot easily be assessed by an external observer. It requires formative assessment which typically stretches over a longer period of time. This type of assessment can, but not necessarily, be self-assessment.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">Regular individual and group reflection exercises can help the team members to express the influence of the program on their competence development. Fortunately, multiple tools and exercises already have been tested and developed for this end. For example, the creation of a portfolio and development interviews as described by Judith Gulikers (2023).</p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">More in-depth reflections are provided below for the different stakeholders groups, for example focusing on the question of arising power inequalities in teacher-student assessment.</p>
