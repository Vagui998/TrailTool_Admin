The instructional goals they set for themselves, the educational goals they set forth for students, the teaching methods they use and the way they assess students play major roles in the development of the student.&nbsp;</span></font></p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px;"><font color="#333333" face="Roboto, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 18px;">We may have to move beyond the current higher education structures and attempt to innovate the pedagogical approaches for future generations. To prepare students to meet societyâ€™s future challenges, without overburdening their teachers, alternative teaching formats need to be embraced. We propose the implementation of transdisciplinary innovative learning as a means for you, teachers, to reclaim your valuable relationships with students and help them develop the transversal skills they will need.&nbsp;</span></font></p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px;"></p><p style="margin-bottom: 16px;"><font color="#333333" face="Roboto, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 18px;">You are part of the transdisciplinary team; you are learning yourself while you are guiding the students in their development.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
